<h1>🧪 LAB BUDDY</h1>
</h2>INTELLIGENCE LAB ASSISTANT SYSTEM</h2>
AI that guides, diagnoses, and teaches—inside the lab.<br>

LabBuddy is a modern, web-based platform designed to help students interactively explore and perform laboratory experiments. It provides intuitive UI for experiment selection, real-time guidance, and backend-powered insights — making practical learning easier, clearer, and more reliable.

<h1>🔧TECH STACK</h1>
<h2>FRONTEND</h2>

React — UI foundation for components and interactive screens

TypeScript — type-safe coding for better reliability

Vite — fast frontend bundler & dev server

Tailwind CSS — utility-first styling

shadcn-ui — component library built on top of Tailwind

<h2>BACKEND</h2>

- STREAMLIT APP — deployed at https://bf4byueekxkcpqse2wdeia.streamlit.app/
- Basic Ohm's law experiment - This Streamlit page acts as an interactive dashboard where users can perform experiments, provide inputs, and view real-time results. It simplifies complex logic into an easy-to-use web interface, making learning and experimentation faster and more intuitive.
